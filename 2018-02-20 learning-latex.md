# learning latex

i started to learn latex, because i've heard of it and i never tried it,
but mostly because i was bored.

i gotta say, it's a pretty nice tool to make documents and presentation slides!

i spent some time playing aroung trying it, and here's what i made: here's the [tex source file](/files/latex/first.tex) and the [final pdf](/files/latex/first.pdf) on my server.


update (april 28): i've found a [cool latex cheatsheet online](https://wch.github.io/latexsheet)!
