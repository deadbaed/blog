# my contributions to the linux kernel

you read it right! i am a contributor to the linux kernel!

... but you are going to be dissapointed: my contributions are not going to change the world, just comments, alignments and documentation and stuff...

i submited something like 10 patches (as of april 10, 2018) and 3 patches have been accepted and are now into the kernel!

if you wanna check them out, you can read them on [kernel.org](https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/log/?qt=author&q=Philippe+Loctaux).

yes, i am aware that Linus has a copy of the repo on github, but when [i try to see my commits on github](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commits?author=x4m3), i can't get them because there is too many commits and github can't get me the list.

so, here are my kernel contributions, listed by date:

 - [feb 23, 2016](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/81c18a9e378c87ed6559a4b0a0c2831c88947373)
 - [mar 7, 2016](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/ce6550818280c1e7caae727d2b9504140b6370f0)
 - [dec 28, 2017](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/9d4c0c9f6a747a9bdec03057be4193994839ec87)

pretty cool huh? i'll try to update this list if new patches go in the kernel.

__update (may 12, 2018)__: fixed the github urls
