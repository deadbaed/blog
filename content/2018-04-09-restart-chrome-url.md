did you know that you can restart chrome/chromium with a simple url?

here is it: [about://restart](about://restart) !

but this trick does not work with the `<a>` html tag, which seems logical, copy the link and paste it in a new tab to get it to work

it'd be annoying as fuck if you could click on links that restart your browser, imagine if an extension could replace every clickable link with this one! ðŸ˜Š

i think its usage is for chrome developers, the end user doesn't really care to type a url to restart their browser, they click on the `x` and they reopen it (duh).
