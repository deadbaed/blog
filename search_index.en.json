from your computer securely.\nCA and ACME server\nI discovered Smallstep, which allows to become your own ACME server.\nInstall\nThey provide packages for Alpine!\nInstall the packages with\napk add step-cli step-certificates\n\nConfiguration\nStart by creating the folder where step will save all the configs:\nmkdir /etc/step-ca -p\n\nLet's configure step-ca!\nSTEPPATH=/etc/step-ca step ca init --name=\"philt3r\" --acme --address=\"10.131.111.1:444\" --provisioner=\"philt3r\" --deployment-type standalone\n\nI ask it to run on the address 10.131.111.1 (the WireGuard ip) and on the port 444. The port 443 will be used for a https server, so I picked 443 + 1.\nSince I want an ACME server, I asked to get one.\nStep will ask what IP address the clients will use to reach your ca, reply with 10.131.111.1, because only WireGuard peers and the server should be allowed.\nThis will prompt a password, put one.\nStep will generate a root and intermediate key, as well as an intermediate certificate. We don't want that, since we already generated our own.\nCopy these files in /etc/step-ca/certs:\n\nroot_ca.crt\nintermediate_ca.crt\n\nCopy intermediate_ca_key in /etc/step-ca/secrets folder. I use the key directly, but in a safe environment use a Yubikey, but I don't have one.\nStart the CA/ACME server\nRun\nstep-ca /etc/step-ca/config/ca.json\n\nto start the server. It will ask your password to decrypt the intermediate_ca_key. Provide the password.\nThe server should start, stop it.\nWe will now create a file containing the password of the intermediate_ca_key, since we want to have the ACME server starting when Alpine will boot.\nWhy put the password inside a file? Well, simply because we can't type the password at boot. Again, in an ideal environment, use a Yubikey.\nCreate a file at\n/etc/step-ca/password.txt\n\nand place the password inside that file.\nstep should run as the user step-ca, so update the permissions on the config folder:\nchown step-ca:step-ca -Rv /etc/step-ca/\n\nTo verify that everything worked, run:\nstep-ca /etc/step-ca/config/ca.json --password-file=/etc/step-ca/password.txt\n\nStop the server again.\nScript to launch\nStep already has a service!\n\nStart: rc-service step-ca start\nStop: rc-service step-ca stop\n\nUse ACME with Caddy\nNow let's tell Caddy to get TLS certificates with our ACME server.\nEdit the /etc/caddy/Caddyfile:\n# global\n{\n        # step-ca ACME server\n        acme_ca https://10.131.111.1:444/acme/acme/directory\n}\n\nintra.philt3r intra.philt3r:80 {\n        root * /srv/www\n        file_server browse\n}\n\nMake sure step-ca is started, and restart Caddy to make sure everything is good:\nrc-service caddy restart\n\nNow we need to tell our system to trust the certificates.\nDownload the file containing the certificates. It is available at this URL:\nhttps://10.131.111.1:444/roots.pem\n\nOn every device you want to trust your certificates, you will need to download the file on the device, then you will need to tell your operating system to trust it.\n\nOSX: Trust the certificate\niOS: Download the certificate from the device and trust it\nFirefox: Install the certificate on your system and tell firefox to trust it\nLinux distros: Ubuntu, Fedora\n\nStart on boot\nStart caddy and step-ca on startup with:\nrc-update add step-ca\nrc-update add caddy\n\nReboot to make sure everything works.\nResources\n\nhttps://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/Repositories\nAwesome guide that helped me a lot: https://www.apalrd.net/posts/2023/network_acme/\n\n","id":"https://blog.x4m3.rocks/caddy-ca-acme-alpine/","title":"Setup Caddy with a CA and ACME server on Alpine Linux"},"https://blog.x4m3.rocks/coredns-alpine/":{"body":"Now that we have a WireGuard VPN, let's add a DNS server, to type letters instead of numbers!\nInstall CoreDNS\nYou will need to enable the community repo first.\ndoas apk add coredns\n\nConfiguration\nCreate the config in\n/etc/coredns/Corefile\n\n# snippets\n(common) {\n    cache 60\n    acl {\n        allow net 127.0.0.1 10.131.110.0/24 10.131.111.0/24\n        block\n    }\n}\n\n# intranet\nphilt3r {\n    import common\n    log . {combined} {\n        class denial error success\n    }\n\n    hosts {\n        10.131.111.1 intra.philt3r\n        falltrough\n    }\n}\n\n# extranet\n. {\n    import common\n\n    # Free DNS\n    forward . 212.27.40.240 212.27.40.241\n}\n\nMy DNS service of choice comes from free.fr.

When the dd task will be done, the second command we ran will exit as well and you can close that other terminal safely.\n30 is the number of seconds that will update the counter every X seconds.\n","id":"https://blog.x4m3.rocks/dd-status/","title":"dd status"},"https://blog.x4m3.rocks/docker-epitech-moulinette/":{"body":"this guide will show you how to install docker, download the epitech moulinette container and learn how to use it for your projects.\ninstall\nubuntu:\nsudo apt install docker.io\n\narch:\nsudo pacman -S docker\n\nsetup docker before first use\nto use docker without root privileges run\nsudo usermod -aG docker $USER\n\nand REBOOT your computer afterwards for changes to take effect.\nto start docker on every boot\nsudo systemctl enable docker\n\nget the epitech container\ndocker pull epitechcontent/epitest-docker\n\nwill download the epitech moulinette environement. make sure to have fast internet, because the container is about 5 gigabytes.\nstart the container and get a shell\ngo into the directory you want to get a shell in the epitech container.\ndocker run -it --rm -v $(pwd):/home/project -w /home/project epitechcontent/epitest-docker /bin/bash\n\nwill get you a bash prompt: you are now in the container. run the commands you want, and exit the shell when you are done.\nif you are using docker on windows (inside powershell), run\ndocker run -it --rm -v ${pwd}:/home/project -w /home/project epitechcontent/epitest-docker /bin/bash\n\n","id":"https://blog.x4m3.rocks/docker-epitech-moulinette/","title":"how to use the docker of the epitech moulinette"},"https://blog.x4m3.rocks/docker-private-registry/":{"body":"My internal infrastructure is complete. I can now work on my projects, but at some point they need to go out to the world!\nThe platform for most of my projects is the web, and the best tool I found so far to deploy them is Docker.\nI want to keep the code on the private infrastructure, but I also want to be in control of where the docker images will be stored.\nThe perfect solution is a private Docker registry! But it will not be on the internal infrastructure, it will be publicly available on a regular server.\nThat way, projects can be deployed in their final form whenever and wherever, while the source remaining private.\nGet started locally\nTo start, I will launch a test registry on my machine to make sure everything works.\nI will use these docker images:\n\nregistry: The official registry made by Docker themselves\ndocker-registry-ui: A nice webui to view and manage images on the registry\n\nHere's the docker-compose file I used to get started:\nservices:\n\n  registry-server:\n    image: registry:2.8.2\n    ports:\n      - 5000:5000\n    volumes:\n      - ./registry-data:/var/lib/registry\n      - ./passwords:/auth/htpasswd\n    environment:\n      REGISTRY_AUTH: 'htpasswd'\n      REGISTRY_AUTH_HTPASSWD_REALM: 'Registry Realm'\n      REGISTRY_AUTH_HTPASSWD_PATH: '/auth/htpasswd'\n      REGISTRY_HTTP_HEADERS_Access-Control-Origin: '[http://registry.example.com]'\n      REGISTRY_HTTP_HEADERS_Access-Control-Allow-Methods: '[HEAD,GET,OPTIONS,DELETE]'\n      REGISTRY_HTTP_HEADERS_Access-Control-Credentials: '[true]'\n      REGISTRY_HTTP_HEADERS_Access-Control-Allow-Headers: '[Authorization,Accept,Cache-Control]'\n      REGISTRY_HTTP_HEADERS_Access-Control-Expose-Headers: '[Docker-Content-Digest]'\n      REGISTRY_STORAGE_DELETE_ENABLED: 'true'\n    container_name: registry-server\n\n  registry-ui:\n    image: joxit/docker-registry-ui:2.5.0\n    ports:\n      - 8001:80\n    environment:\n      SINGLE_REGISTRY: true\n      REGISTRY_TITLE: Docker Registry UI\n      DELETE_IMAGES: true\n      SHOW_CONTENT_DIGEST: true\n      NGINX_PROXY_PASS_URL: http://registry-server:5000\n      SHOW_CATALOG_NB_TAGS: true\n      CATALOG_MIN_BRANCHES: 1\n      CATALOG_MAX_BRANCHES: 1\n      TAGLIST_PAGE_SIZE: 100\n      REGISTRY_SECURED: false\n      CATALOG_ELEMENTS_LIMIT: 1000\n    container_name: registry-ui\n\nBut don't start the services right away.\nAuthentication\nI don't want the registry being open to everyone though, let's add some authentication.\nTo keep things simple, I will use HTTP basic auth. If you want, there's a possibility to have a more complex setup.\nHere's a quick script to get passwords in a format that Docker will accept:\n#!/bin/sh\n#\n# new-password.sh\n\nif [ -z \"$1\" ]\nthen\necho \"usage: $0 username\"\nexit 1\nfi\n\necho \"creating password for user \\\"$1\\\"\"\nhtpasswd -nB $1\n\nHow to use it:\n$ ./new-password.sh phil\ncreating password for user \"phil\"\nNew password: phil\nRe-type new password: phil\nphil:$2y$05$asxsqfmEQJpg8zuKGyieMOmTirok.Gd/noliF.y48DJXe.97ufGHG\n\nCopy the last line in the passwords file (see the docker-compose file).\nRepeat the process for every user you want to give authentication to your registry.\nKeep in mind I only cover AUTHENTICATION (who can access the registry), and not AUTHORIZATION (who can do what on the registry). With this setup, if you have access to the registry, you can do anything on it.\nUse the registry\nStart the services with\ndocker compose up\n\nNow, you can access the webui by going to\nhttp://localhost:8001\n\nin a web browser and sign-in with your credentials. You should see an empty list. Let's add some images!\nNaming images\nPick an image you want on the registry.\nIf it's an existing image:\ndocker tag name-of-existing-image localhost:5000/existing-image-name\n\nIf you build the image directly:\ndocker build -t localhost:5000/new-image-name\n\nThe name of the image must have the domain of the registry, in our case it's localhost:5000.\nLogin to registry\nTo sign in to the registry, use\ndocker login localhost:5000\n\nand enter your credentials.\nPush / Pull\nSimply run the usual docker command to push or pull images. Docker will know which registry to use based of the image's name.\ndocker push localhost:5000/new-image-name\ndocker pull localhost:5000/existing-image-name\n\nThat's pretty much it!\nDeploy to production\nI use Caprover to deploy my docker images easily, it comes with a reverse proxy and automatic TLS certificates with Let's encrypt.\nHere's the one-click-app config I created for the registry:\ncaptainVersion: 4\n\nservices:\n  $$cap_appname-registry:\n    image: registry:$$cap_registry_version\n    volumes:\n      - $$cap_appname-data:/var/lib/registry\n      - $$cap_appname-auth:/auth/\n    environment:\n      REGISTRY_AUTH: 'htpasswd'\n      REGISTRY_AUTH_HTPASSWD_REALM: 'Registry Realm'\n      REGISTRY_AUTH_HTPASSWD_PATH: '/auth/htpasswd'\n      REGISTRY_HTTP_HEADERS_Access-Control-Origin: '[https://$$cap_appname-registry.$$cap_root_domain, https://$$cap_appname-ui.$$cap_root_domain]'\n      REGISTRY_HTTP_HEADERS_Access-Control-Allow-Methods: '[HEAD,GET,OPTIONS,DELETE]'\n      REGISTRY_HTTP_HEADERS_Access-Control-Credentials: '[true]'\n      REGISTRY_HTTP_HEADERS_Access-Control-Allow-Headers: '[Authorization,Accept,Cache-Control]'\n      REGISTRY_HTTP_HEADERS_Access-Control-Expose-Headers: '[Docker-Content-Digest]'\n      REGISTRY_STORAGE_DELETE_ENABLED: 'true'\n    caproverExtra:\n        containerHttpPort: '5000'\n\n  $$cap_appname-ui:\n    image: joxit/docker-registry-ui:$$cap_ui_version\n    environment:\n      SINGLE_REGISTRY: true\n      REGISTRY_TITLE: Docker Registry UI\n      DELETE_IMAGES: true\n      SHOW_CONTENT_DIGEST: true\n      NGINX_PROXY_PASS_URL: http://srv-captain--$$cap_appname-registry:5000\n      SHOW_CATALOG_NB_TAGS: true\n      CATALOG_MIN_BRANCHES: 1\n      CATALOG_MAX_BRANCHES: 1\n      TAGLIST_PAGE_SIZE: 100\n      REGISTRY_SECURED: false\n      CATALOG_ELEMENTS_LIMIT: 1000\n\ncaproverOneClickApp:\n    variables:\n        - id: '$$cap_registry_version'\n          label: Registry Version\n          defaultValue: '2.8.2'\n          description: Check out the Docker page for the valid tags https://hub.docker.com/_/registry/tags\n          validRegex: \"/.{1,}/\"\n        - id: '$$cap_ui_version'\n          label: UI Version\n          defaultValue: '2.5.0'\n          description: Check out the Docker page for the valid tags https://hub.docker.com/r/joxit/docker-registry-ui/tags\n          validRegex: \"/.{1,}/\"\n    instructions:\n        start: |-\n            A private docker registry, with a webui to see images\n        end: |-\n            The registry has been deployed!

there's just one thing that could be perfect: the boot logo.\nby default on new models, your boot logo look like this:\n\nto get a custom boot logo, you need:\n\nan internet connection\na compatible model\na usb flash drive\na gif image (you can also use a bmp or a jpg image, but i've found that with gif images it works better)\n\nget the BIOS update\nto install your custom boot logo, you need to flash a BIOS update.\nto download the BIOS update, go on lenovo's support website, choose drivers and updates and find your model.\nnext, go in the section BIOS/UEFI and download the BIOS Update (Bootable CD). it will download a iso image.\nif you can't find the update image, that means that you're out of luck, and you can't get a custom boot logo. sorry.\nconvert the iso image\nnow that you have the iso image, you need to convert it to a img file. to do so, run the following command in a terminal:\ngeteltorito -o bios-image.img bios-image-downloaded.iso\n\nif you don't have geteltorito, look online to install it.\nflash the image on your usb drive\nnow it's time to flash the image on your usb drive. get the name of your flash drive using lsblk, plug your usb drive, and run lsblk again to see your drive.\ngo into the folder where the img file is located, and run in a terminal:\nsudo dd if=bios-image.img of=/dev/sdX bs=1M status=progress oflag=sync\n\nwhere X is your drive letter that you know thanks to lsblk.\nget the gif file to use\nif you want, i already have this selection of images ready to be used, or you can make your own!\n\n\n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \n    \n\nyou can see the requirements, go in your usb drive, open the readme.txt in the flash folder.\nput the gif image in the flash folder, and name it LOGO1.JPG. copy that image, and name that one LOGO2.JPG.\ncheck the readme.txt file to see the filenames, they might differ on different models.\nflash the BIOS update\nreboot your computer, and boot on the usb flash drive. if you don't know how, the internet should help you with that.\nnow that the flash utility has booted, choose the second option, and follow the instructions.\nthe computer will reboot, flash the update, and when it will reboot, you should get your custom boot logo!\n\nif you want to go back to the default logo, simply reflash the bios update, when when asked if you want to use your custom logo, say no, and the default logo will be put back.\n","id":"https://blog.x4m3.rocks/thinkpad-custom-boot-logo/","title":"how to put a custom boot logo on a thinkpad"},"https://blog.x4m3.rocks/wireguard-alpine/":{"body":"Let's do this baremetal, no Docker!\nI will do this inside a Proxmox virtual machine.\nGet started\nStart by installing Alpine Linux: Run the installer, next, next, next, and boot the os once it's done.\nSetup ssh\nCopy ssh key (run this on your local machine):\nssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub user@ip\n\nLogin via ssh, and install your favorite editor:\ndoas apk add vim\n\nEdit ssh config to force ssh key use:\ndoas vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config\n\nFind and update these statements:\nPermitRootLogin no\nPubkeyAuthentication yes\n\nRestart ssh service, logout, and log back in\ndoas rc-service sshd restart\n\nSetup alpine package manager\nI use mirrors.ircam.fr as my mirror\nOpen \n/etc/apk/repositories\n\nadd the community repo, and run updates:\ndoas apk -U upgrade\n\nWireGuard basics\nInstall WireGuard:\ndoas apk add wireguard-tools\n\nKernel module\nLoad the module\ndoas modprobe wireguard\n\nTo launch the module on startup, edit\n/etc/modules\n\nand simply add\nwireguard\n\nat the bottom, and save the file.\nIP forwarding\nEdit\n/etc/sysctl.conf\n\nand add\nnet.ipv4.ip_forward = 1\n\nat the bottom of the file, and save\nLaunch sysctl on startup with\ndoas rc-update add sysctl\n\nand reboot.\nIP Addresses\nPick a range if ip addresses to use: RFC 1918\nI'll pick 10.131.111.x for the WireGuard peers.\nCalculate your CIDR: https://www.ipaddressguide.com/cidr\nHere's my network layout:\n\nCIDR: 10.131.110.0/23\nStart: 10.131.110.0\nEnd: 10.131.111.255\n\nNetwork services:\n\nStart: 10.131.110.0/24\nEnd: 10.131.110.255/24\n\nWireGuard:\n\nStart: 10.131.111.0/24\nEnd: 10.131.111.255/24\n\nGenerate keys for WireGuard\nDo everything as root (doas is the equivalent of sudo):\ndoas su\n\nMove to the wireguard configuration, I'll store everything there for easy access:\ncd /etc/wireguard/\n\nGenerate the private and public key, store them in files (we'll use them later):\nwg genkey | tee philt3r-privatekey | wg pubkey &gt;

You should see the peer and some stats it is connected.\nIf you do not see info about the peer even if it is not connected, that means you did something wrong in the configuration!\nFrom your peer, you should be able to ping the WireGuard internal IP:\n10.131.111.1\n\n\niOS: Ping\nOSX / Linux: ping\n\nIf you can ping the ip, you're good!\nYou may not be able to go on the internet, or even make DNS requests, it's normal.\nWe are just testing if the tunnel works. You can stop the tunnel.\nStop WireGuard manually\nwg-quick down wg0\n\nScript to launch on server startup\nTo start WireGuard on startup, we will write an OpenRC script.
